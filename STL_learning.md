## Learning C++ STL(Standard Template Library)
All programs manipulate data.
You need to know:
• How to use the powerful random-number-generation facilities 
• How to work with dates and times 
• What smart pointers are and how to use them to prevent memory leaks 
• How to use containers to efficiently store and retrieve your data 
• How to use algorithms to inspect and manipulate your data 
• How lambda expressions allow for elegant use of algorithms 
• What functionality the library provides for file and 
stream-based I/O 
• How to work with characters and strings in C++ 
• How to write localized applications 
• How to write safe and efficient multithreaded code using the C++11 
concurrency library 
• How to correctly handle error conditions and exceptions 
• And more!
